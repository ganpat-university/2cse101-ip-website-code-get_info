Manchester City were the only English side to win their Champions League opener in midweek, but have problems of their own with an injury-ravaged defence exposed in a shocking 2-3 defeat to Norwich last weekend, leaving the champions five points adrift of leaders Liverpool. Pep Guardiola's men will be confident of cutting that gap as they host bottom-of-the-table Watford 24 hours before Liverpool travel to Chelsea on Sunday.</h3></img></p></div>

After the US Open where he took a set off Swiss maestro Roger Federer before losing the match, Nagal had jumped 16 places.
